# Global Data on Sustainable Energy

## Overview

This project analyzes global trends in access to sustainable energy using data from 2000 to 2020. It focuses on key metrics such as access to electricity and clean cooking fuels across various countries. The analysis identifies top-performing countries in terms of improvement and highlights regions that still face significant energy access challenges.

## Objectives

- Determine which countries experienced the largest increase in access to electricity from 2000 to 2020.
- Identify the countries with the greatest improvements in access to clean fuels and technologies for cooking.
- Highlight the countries with the lowest access to clean fuels in 2020.
- Visualize these trends using clear and informative plots.

## Dataset

The dataset used includes:
- Country names
- Access to electricity (% of population) in 2000 and 2020
- Access to clean fuels and technologies for cooking (% of population) in 2000 and 2020

## Tools and Technologies

- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

## Key Analyses

1. **Access to Electricity Growth**  
   Computed the change in electricity access percentage between 2000 and 2020 for each country and identified the top 10 gainers.

2. **Access to Clean Fuels Growth**  
   Analyzed the increase in access to clean cooking fuels between 2000 and 2020, highlighting the top 10 countries.

3. **Countries with Lowest Access to Clean Fuels in 2020**  
   Identified and visualized countries with the least access to clean cooking technologies in the most recent year available.

## Visualizations

- Bar charts for the top countries in electricity access improvement.
- Bar charts for improvements in clean cooking fuel access.
- Bar chart showing countries with lowest clean fuel access in 2020.

## Conclusion

The analysis provides insights into global energy access disparities and progress. While some countries have made remarkable improvements, others continue to face challenges, particularly with clean fuel access.
